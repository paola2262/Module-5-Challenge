## Data Description

Data generated by MockarooLinks to an external site., LLC (2022). Realistic Data Generator.Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational 
purposes only.

This project examines data regarding cancer treatment in mice to understand the effectiveness 
of different treatment plans, the connection between mouse traits and tumor advancement, and the detection of possible outliers needing more investigation.

## Files Included

Mouse Metadata: Contains information about mice, including their unique IDs, drug regimens, sex, age, and weight.
Study Results: Provides data on the results of cancer treatment studies in mice, including timepoints, tumor volumes, and metastatic sites.

## Key Metrics
* Tumor Volume Distribution
  The box plot reveals variability and central tendency of tumor volumes across treatments, highlighting potential outliers like Infubinol.
* Weight vs. Tumor Volume
  A positive correlation between weight and tumor volume in the Capomulin regimen suggests weight-related factors may influence tumor growth dynamics.
* Treatment Efficacy
  Capomulin and Ramicane have the highest observations, indicating their effectiveness in tumor treatment.
* Correlation Between Variables
  Calculating correlation coefficients offers insights into the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.
* Identification of Outliers
  Analyzing outliers helps identify irregular treatment responses requiring further investigation.
* Data Preparation
  Merging datasets and removing duplicates ensures data accuracy, facilitating exploratory analysis.
            
## Results

This analysis offers valuable insights for future research and improving cancer treatment strategies by understanding treatment effectiveness and influencing factors.
